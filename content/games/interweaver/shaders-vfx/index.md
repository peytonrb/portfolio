## Overview
A main goal that I had as Creative Director was to deliver an experience that was both fun to play but also visually appealing and whimsical, which immersed the player in the magical world Interweaver took place in. The Art Team and I settled on a stylized, almost hand-drawn aesthetic early into production, which was ideal for our smaller team of emerging artists. 

I personally played a key role in this initiative as the main Technical Artist, and was responsible for the majority of shaders, VFX, and post-production effects that shipped with the final product and helped define the game's visual identity. I was also responsible for ensuring they were seamlessly integrated into the game's systems and animations without causing any performance issues, including lag or frame drops.
