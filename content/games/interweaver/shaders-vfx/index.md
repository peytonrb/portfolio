## Overview
A main goal that I had as Creative Director was to deliver an experience that was both fun to play but also visually appealing and whimsical, which immersed the player in the magical world Interweaver took place in. The Art Team and I settled on a **stylized, almost hand-drawn aesthetic** early into production, which was ideal for our smaller team of emerging artists. 

I personally played a key role in this initiative as the main Technical Artist, and was responsible for the majority of shaders, VFX, and post-production effects that shipped with the final product and helped define the game's visual identity. I was also responsible for ensuring they were seamlessly integrated into the game's systems and animations without causing any performance issues, including lag or frame drops. 

## Shaders/HLSL
I was responsible for authoring the vast majority of shaders used throughout Interweaver, which were applied to objects, the game environment, and supplemented visual effects. These shaders were crucial in defining the game's distinct visual aesthetic. I created most of my shadersk using **ShaderGraph** in Unity, with a few coupled with **HLSL** for more advanced effects and to optimize performance when necessary.

### Environment and Character Shader
[Had to create an overall shader to make the game fit the desired hand-painted stylized aesthetic]. It was really important that the shader lowered contrast, applied a painted look, and [gave it a __ look].

#### Ripple Shader

## VFX Showcase
Along with the Shaders, I created 30+ VFX and particle systems for Interweaver to supporting the game's visual direction and providing players with meaningful feedback as they used mechanics and progressed through the game. These were mainly done in Unity's **VFX Graph** and involved custom 3D models, textures, and [many calculations]. 

Here I will showcase most of the effects I made for Interweaver below. I tried to include the software used to create the effects as well as any additional interesting information:
