   displayDescription: "Interweaver was a concept that I created, pitched, and was chosen out of a collection of ~40 concepts to be developed into a 
                        full game. Here I've documented some of the creative process that went into turning this vision into reality."

## Overview
Interweaver began as a concept I developed about the world, the main characters, and their abilities in-game. Out of around 40 game pitches, it was selected as one of three concepts to be developed into a fully-realized game by popular vote. As we progressed through development, Interweaver's many distinctive features evolved to make the game into what it is today.

The team consisted of 14 students, and together with my Producer we established a leadership team and established production pipelines for art, code, and design. We fostered a collaborative environment that encouraged creative discussion from the team whenever possible, and I maintained ownership of the creative direction, approving all production-ready assets to ensure everything shipped with our quality and visual standards.

## Concept Art + Brainstorms
I wanted to illustrate some of the early concepts that I had for Interweaver to give some context on how the game evolved to what you see on Steam today. It is important to call out that this project was developed on a 35-week timeline with Senior Design students of various skill levels, and throughout development, we encountered a range of technical, leadership, and design challenges that influenced how the original concept evolved into the final game. I learned so much about the full game development process and what it takes to lead effectively in a fast-faced production environment. Enjoy :)
