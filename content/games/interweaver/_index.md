### Creative Director, Gameplay Engineer, Lead Technical Artist
Interweaver is an isometric puzzle-platformer built in **Unity** by a small team of students from the University of Central Florida as our Senior Design Capstone. I served as the Creative Director and was also responsible for programming a variety of major systems and mechanics in **C#** and created the majority of the visual effects in Unity's **Shader** and **VFX Graph**. 

This was my first experience leading a full development team of designers, artists, and programmers. I was at the forefront of production and development, and formed a leadership team that quickly became comfortable with Agile development strategies to create the best player experience during our 35-week production period.

## Development Log
I contributed heavily to this project from all aspects of production: code, art, and design. Below I will go into depth on major systems, features, and effects I am responsible for, as well as trying to explain some design decisions and philosophies that I learned during this experience.
