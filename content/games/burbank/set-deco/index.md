## Overview
Project Burbank is a platform for players to create and play out any story imaginable - it takes players' gameplay decisions and responds uniquely to further set the stage for individually customized interactions. I supported this feature physically in game with, what is internally called, the **Set Deco System**. This procedural interior decoration system is responsible for intaking information about the unique story being followed by the player at runtime and filling subsequent Levels with contextually appropriate assets, while also maintaining navigable space and realistic orientations.

This system required deep understanding of a variety of Unreal systems, including **Procedural Content Generation (PCG)**, **World Partition and Data Layers**, **Choosers** (RandTable?), and more.

## Gameplay Implementation
- Screenshot Data Layers and empty socketed Layer
- show progress as stuff gets added over time


## Technical Spec
Below is the official Technical Design Document that I wrote for this system's development.
