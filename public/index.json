I supported this characteristic by creating a procedural interior decoration system that intakes information about the player\u0026rsquo;s campaign at runtime and filling subsequent Levels with contextually appropriate assets, while also maintaining navigable space and realistic orientations.\nThis system was not only instrumental in establishing the mood and feel of a Level in game, but it was also visually and mechanically obvious if there were any logical flaws. It also had to handle external systems like lighting, BP Actors in the Level, player-placed objects, cameras, and more. It was imperative that I ensured this system was able to handle not only our technical limitations, but also uplifted the player\u0026rsquo;s experience.\nThis system required deep understanding of a variety of Unreal systems, including Procedural Content Generation (PCG), World Partition and Data Layers, Choosers (RandTable?), and more.\nIn-Game Representation\r#\rEach Level is constructed at design-time with base 3D models as a greybox to outline the general shape and orientation of objects in space. Each Level in UE is constructed with a variety of Data Layers containing different Socket Actors to hold contextual data and act as a base in order to preserve navigable space and Actor Slot requirements. The Decoration system then reads the Socket Actors and the current campaign information and chooses assets to sort and where to place them accordingly.\nYou can see 2 base Layout examples from our Apartment Level below:\nAfter the Decoration system finishes placing assets on the determined base layout, the final in-game Level now contextually fits the unique story being played out and also furthers player immersion:\nTechnical Spec\r#\rBelow I\u0026rsquo;ve condensed the official Technical Design Document I wrote for this system to give an idea of how the system worked.\nKey Learnings\r#\r","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/burbank/set-deco/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Procedural Interior Decoration","type":"games"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/interweaver/puzzles/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Puzzles","type":"games"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/burbank/relationships/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Relationships and Character Memories","type":"games"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/interweaver/shaders-vfx/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Shaders and VFX","type":"games"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/burbank/slate-ui/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Slate Tooling","type":"games"},{"content":"Below are games that I have worked on professionally, academically, and personally.

Burbank uniquely explores player connection with characters and storylines through life sim/visual novel sandbox-style gameplay. I am responsible for several core systems and have a hand in nearly every feature of the game.\nThis project was unique in its timeframe - we rapidly designed, engineered, and iterated on all systems and pipelines to meet tight demo deadlines. As a result, as well as creating gameplay mechanics in C++ and Blueprint, I also became fluent in Slate to customize our Editor and tooling to support our designers as we rapidly iterated on the games\u0026rsquo; development.\nDevelopment Log\r#\rDue to the small team size of 13, my skills were leveraged in a variety of ways to support all aspects of the game. Below are some of the major systems and features I contributed to Project Burbank:\n","date":"1 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/burbank/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Project Burbank","type":"games"},{"content":"\rCreative Director, Gameplay Programmer, Lead Technical Artist\r#\rInterweaver is an isometric puzzle-platformer built in Unity by a small team of students from the University of Central Florida as our Senior Design Capstone. I served as the Creative Director and was also responsible for programming a variety of major systems and mechanics in C# and created the majority of the visual effects in Unity\u0026rsquo;s Shader and VFX Graph.\nThis was my first experience leading a full development team of designers, artists, and programmers. I was at the forefront of production and development, and formed a leadership team that quickly became comfortable with Agile development strategies to create the best player experience during our 35-week production period.\nYou can find the Steam page here.\nDevelopment Log\r#\rI contributed heavily to this project from all aspects of production: code, art, and design. Below I will go into depth on major systems, features, and effects I am responsible for, as well as trying to explain some design decisions and philosophies that I learned during this experience.\n","date":"20 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/interweaver/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Interweaver","type":"games"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"Peyton Bischof","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resume/","section":"Peyton Bischof","summary":"","title":"Resume","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
