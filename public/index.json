I supported this feature physically in game with, what is internally called, the Set Deco System. This procedural interior decoration system is responsible for intaking information about the unique story being followed by the player at runtime and filling subsequent Levels with contextually appropriate assets, while also maintaining navigable space and realistic orientations.\nThis system required deep understanding of a variety of Unreal systems, including Procedural Content Generation (PCG), World Partition and Data Layers, Choosers (RandTable?), and more.\nGameplay Implementation\r#\rScreenshot Data Layers and empty socketed Layer show progress as stuff gets added over time Technical Spec\r#\rBelow is the official Technical Design Document that I wrote for this system\u0026rsquo;s development.\nPCG Exploration\r#\r","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/burbank/set-deco/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Procedural Interior Decoration","type":"games"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/interweaver/puzzles/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Puzzles","type":"games"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/burbank/relationships/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Relationships and Character Memories","type":"games"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/interweaver/shaders-vfx/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Shaders and VFX","type":"games"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/burbank/slate-ui/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Slate UI","type":"games"},{"content":"Below are games that I have worked on professionally, academically, and personally.

Burbank uniquely explores player connection with characters and storylines via our life sim/visual novel sandbox-style gameplay. I am responsible for several core systems and have a hand in nearly every feature of the game.\nThis project was unique in its timeframe - we rapidly designed, engineered, and iterated on all systems and pipelines to meet tight demo deadlines. As a result, as well as creating gameplay mechanics in C++ and Blueprint, I also became fluent in Slate to customize our Editor and tooling to support our designers as we rapidly iterated on the games\u0026rsquo; development.\nDevelopment Log\r#\rDue to the small team size of 13, my skills were leveraged in a variety of ways to support all aspects of the game. Below are some of the major systems and features I contributed to Project Burbank:\n","date":"1 May 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/burbank/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Project Burbank","type":"games"},{"content":"\rCreative Director, Gameplay Programmer, Lead Technical Artist\r#\rInterweaver is an isometric puzzle-platformer built in Unity by a small team of students from the University of Central Florida as our Senior Design Capstone. I served as the Creative Director and was also responsible for programming a variety of major systems and mechanics in C# and created the majority of the visual effects in Unity\u0026rsquo;s Shader and VFX Graph.\nThis was my first experience leading a full development team of designers, artists, and programmers. I was at the forefront of production and development, and formed a leadership team that quickly became comfortable with Agile development strategies to create the best player experience during our 35-week production period.\nYou can find the Steam page here.\nDevelopment Log\r#\rI contributed heavily to this project from all aspects of production: code, art, and design. Below I will go into depth on major systems, features, and effects I am responsible for, as well as trying to explain some design decisions and philosophies that I learned during this experience.\n","date":"20 May 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/games/interweaver/","section":"Games","summary":"","title":"Interweaver","type":"games"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/contact/","section":"Peyton Bischof","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/resume/","section":"Peyton Bischof","summary":"","title":"Resume","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
